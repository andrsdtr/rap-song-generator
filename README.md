# Rap Song Generator
### A project to explore the capabilities of LangChain.

In this project I developed an agent that takes a historical event as an input and generates a rap song about it.

I explored various capabilities of LangChain, including:
- **Prompt-Templates** &rarr; Alowing the user to input only the event name
- **LLM-Chains** &rarr; Using templates to sequentially generate titles and text
- **Chat-Memory** &rarr; Enabling the review of generated texts
- **Information Retrieval** &rarr; Leveraging external sources (WikiAPI) to ensure historical accuracy
